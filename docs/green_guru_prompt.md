# GreenGuru Plant Care App Prompt

Design a Flutter mobile application called **"GreenGuru"** that acts as a comprehensive plant encyclopedia and care assistant tailored for Indian gardeners. The generated application (code or prototype) must implement the following capabilities:

## Core Experience
- Provide a global search bar that lets users type any plant name and instantly retrieve its profile.
- Display a structured response with the sections **Overview, Soil, Watering, Care, Placement, Diseases, Medicines, FAQs**, and localized Indian gardening tips for every search.
- Support bilingual content for English and Hindi, with an accessible, minimal UI optimized for Indian users.

## Plant Knowledge Base
- Maintain a rich, searchable, and filterable plant database that includes:
  - Common and scientific names, species, origin, and descriptive details.
  - Soil requirements, preparation guides, and fertilization advice.
  - Watering guidance with percentages, seasonal schedules, and climate-specific adjustments.
  - Placement recommendations (indoor/outdoor) covering light, humidity, and temperature preferences.
  - Step-by-step planting and propagation instructions.
- Allow browsing by plant categories and saving favorites for quick access.

## Health & Disease Management
- List common diseases, symptoms, and prevention tips for each plant.
- Offer real-time alerts, FAQs, and optionally accept plant photos for AI-assisted disease detection.
- Recommend medicines, pesticides, and organic remedies tailored to the detected issues.

## Personalized Care Tools
- Provide an optional personalized care checklist with reminders for watering, fertilizing, repotting, pruning, and sunlight exposure.
- Enable configurable notifications to help users manage plant health proactively.

## Community & Media Features
- Include a community forum where users can ask questions, share plant photos, and exchange tips.
- Support an AI-powered image recognition workflow that can identify plant species from uploaded photos and auto-populate care details (advanced feature).

## Technical Expectations
- Build the UI with Flutter widgets following best practices for responsiveness and accessibility.
- Structure the code for scalability with separate modules for data models, services, UI screens, and localization.
- Ensure the database layer (local or remote) is easily updatable with new plants and disease records.
- Incorporate hooks for machine learning models to power image recognition and disease detection when available.
- Implement testing stubs or guidance for key features such as data retrieval, reminders, and image recognition.

Use this prompt as a requirement document for AI-assisted development tools, app builders, or to brief developers responsible for implementing the GreenGuru app.
