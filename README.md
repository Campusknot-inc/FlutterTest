This repository contains a Flutter project and supporting documentation for building rich mobile experiences.

## GreenGuru Prompt

The [`docs/green_guru_prompt.md`](docs/green_guru_prompt.md) file provides a detailed requirements prompt for generating a Flutter application called **GreenGuru**. The app acts as a plant encyclopedia and care assistant for Indian gardeners with features such as:

- Searchable plant database with structured sections (Overview, Soil, Watering, Care, Placement, Diseases, Medicines, FAQs).
- Soil, watering, light, and placement guidance tailored to each plant.
- Disease identification, treatment recommendations, and optional AI-powered image recognition.
- Personalized care reminders, bilingual (English/Hindi) support, and a community forum for sharing tips.

Use the prompt with AI-assisted development tools or as a reference when briefing developers tasked with implementing the GreenGuru experience.
